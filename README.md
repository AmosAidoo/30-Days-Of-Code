# 30-Days-Of-Code

30 Days of Code is a very nice and fun way of learning a new programming language. Sometimes learning a new language, especially with a new paradigm than the one you know, can be quite difficult. 30 Days of Code has got you covered in that department. Even if it isn't hard, who doesn't want to have fun. Lets see how far I go with this :upside_down_face:

# Languages so far:
- Haskell

# Structure
So every language has a separate directory for it. Within this directory are sub-directories foro each day. Each sub-directory contains a README.md file explaining some stuff about the code

Please follow the structure above
